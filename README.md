## FAQ

#### Why a NameIdMapping.json file?

The only way to make EmpyrionBackpackExtender store items by name instead of id is to use a `NameIdMapping.json` file.
This allows for your virtual backpacks to work across different saves.

#### Why a 3rd party application to generate the file?

Unfortunately the mapping file isn't generated by EmpyrionBackpackExtender.
Until now you can only get one by using [ASTIC](https://github.com/GitHub-TC)'s other mod [EmpyrionScripting](https://github.com/GitHub-TC/EmpyrionScripting).


#### How do I use the file once it's generated?

Once the file is generated the program will give you directions on how to use it.
